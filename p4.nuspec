    <summary>Helix Core admins and advanced users use Perforce p4 (the command-line client) to gain instant access to operations and complete control over the system.</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[The P4 command-line client provides access to all Perforce features and functions as an interface for scripting and automated operations.

Customize automation for your development and administrative processes by embedding commands using Perl, Python, or any other scripting language. You can tailor operations for automating Continuous Integration/Continuous Development (CI/CD) to create your ideal workflow.

The Perforce P4 Command-Line Client uses the same commands and syntax on a wide variety of platforms. It automatically translates line ending conventions between operating systems.
